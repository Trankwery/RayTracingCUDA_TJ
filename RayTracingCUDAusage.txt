How we used CUDA to run ray-tracing - main steps of CUDA algorythm.
Author: Tomasz Jakubczyk
1. Ray-tracing data is loaded from matlab memory to graphic card memmory.
2. Ray-tracing function, called kernel, is executed on graphic card in 
masivly multiple threads. Each thread has pointer to data and its own, 
unique in single kernel call, number so each thread can access different part of data
and each piece of data has its own thread executing ray-tracing function. 
For best performence and to avoid collisions differet threads shuldn't write 
at same memmory address.
3. To produce values of immage matrix addition of values from different threads is needed.
The result of unsychronized additions in simultaneous threads to value at one address may
be undeterministic.
To avoid undeterministic results atomic addition is used. Atomic function is special
function witch guarantees indivisible access to variable at specific address.
Fortunetly in our case this synchronization operation isn't very costly becase only few
threads needs to access the same cell of immage matrix.
4. Results are copied from graphic cards memmory to matlab memmory.
